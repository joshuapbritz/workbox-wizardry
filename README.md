[A talk for the Google Developer Group Johannesburg meetup on 10 October 2018](https://www.meetup.com/GDGJohannesburg/events/254788415/)

Service workers are powerful features of modern web experiences that seem like a whole bunch of black magic to the uninitiated. A proliferation of frameworks, an array of browser APIs, and a slew of tools all combine to cast a pall of confusion over the topic. Never fear; we will use the incredible Workbox library (and tools) to dispel all shadows of doubt, and confidently build service workers.

This code-oriented talk takes an extensive look at the different ways workbox can be used. It shows different pre- and runtime-caching strategies, explains the challenges behind service worker life cycle events, and explores offline strategies using background sync. It will even show you how workbox can be used on traditional server-side websites - giving them a real performance boost. So come along, level up, and add a few more incantations to your spellbook.
